# WAIT! Animate

[waitanimate.wstone.uk](https://waitanimate.wstone.uk/)

## Development

Install the dependencies...

```bash
yarn
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
yarn dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see the app
running.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow
connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to
include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
yarn build
```

You can run the newly built app with `yarn start`.
